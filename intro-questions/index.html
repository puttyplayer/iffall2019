            <li> David Bromberg, Sophomore, Independently Designed Major in Engineering. My major combines English, Computer Science, and Design to provide skills for the modern AI based world.</li>
            <li>I am interested in design and web design but do not have a formal art background. This class seemed like a natural introduction to design that builds on my existing coding skills.</li>
            <li>Yes. I am experienced with HTML/CSS/JS. I have taken Web Design (CSE 204) and I am currently taking rapid prototyping (CSE330) in Engineering.</li>
            <li>I want to learn how to design beautiful web pages. </li>
            <li>I have only designed for screens, but imagine that you have to take into account different screen sizes versus a single paper size.</li>
            <li> nytimes.com is an example of a good web design. It is based on the design of a news paper. The page is highly functional and allows the user to preview stories before clicking on them. It is not flashy, but well thought out. </li>
            <li>https://www.shopify.com/free-trial This link exemplifies good communication. It explains what shopify is and the pricing effectively. </li>
            <li>Instgram is a website that works well. It is simple, focuses on one item, browsing photos, and is not distracting.</li>
