    <ul>
        <li>I would center the quotes in the side panel. It will make the space more even</li>
        <li>For the desktop, it might look nice to decrease the font size so more words can fit in a line</li>
        <li>In the second image, there might not be a solution to this, but there is a large gap after like because assuming doesnt fit on the line. I dont have a solution for this, maybe try to change something.</li>
    </ul>
